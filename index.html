              <h3>A Brief History</h3>
            <p>Christ Church Girls' School is one of the two remaining all girls' primary schools in Barbados. The school has its origins in the Kingsland Girls' School which was opened in 1898 on the Kingsland Estates. In 1921 the school was moved to its present location and in 1926 it was amalgamated with the Providence Girls' School to form the Christ Church Girls' School.</p>
              
              <p>Over the years, the Christ Church Girls' School has been fortunate to be under the leadership and knowledge of foward-looking principals including Miss Hewitt and Miss Eugenia Carter-Hinds. The latter whose tenure lasted from 1944-68 is credited with composing the School Song, instituting the school's P.T.A. in 1954 and initiating the school's Savings Co-operative (the first in the island)in 1968. Other principals were Mrs. Amerel Haynes, Miss Adele Smith, Mrs. Glenis Nurse, Mrs. Coral Padmore and Mrs. Heather Bryan.</p>
